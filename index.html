				My name is Samuel Radford.  This resume page was created as a portfolio project in my Web Development Boot Camp. 
				It is meant to show off my education, skills, experience, and projects.  I began studying Computer Science my junior year of high school, 
				where we learned using Pascal and C++.  I continued on to study Computer Science at Appalachian State University where 
				I learned skills in Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and MySQL. While in school I taught myself development for Android.  
				I received a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from Appalachian State Univeristy. 
				Next, I attended a boot camp which focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, MySQL, and C#.  Since the boot camp I have worked 
				as a full stack web developer for AT&T and SharkDreams.  I frequently work on personal projects as well.</p>
